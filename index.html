 Hi!!! I am an enthusiasic , goal oriented , motivaltionally driven person. I come from a beautiful city known for its attequates and "tehzeeb"-Lucknow. This capital city of Uttar Pradesh is a quiet place though just like any other city traffic deinitely irritates you.I did my schooling here but for further studies I moved to Bengaluru, The IT HUB of India. This city might not feel like home but it definitely does have lot to offer. To be honest, one just can't be bored here. Although unlike Lucknow it isn't quite at all but it definitely has both life and lights.I have an extremely loving family and I am just so blessed to have them in life.

    Talking about favourite colours , I have always found the <b>yellow and white colour </b> combination more satisftying than those traiditional pinks and purples.These colours look so positive and bright to me that I am always attracted to them.Yellow colour might be disliked by a lot of people but for me a bright one definitely pleases my eyes.
